        <li>Lack of hairstyles showcases a bigger issue with a lack of diversity in the game dev scene</li>
        <li>By working on amplifying the voices of black gamers, the community as a whole can aid in fighting against discrimination in virtual spaces</li>
        <li>Employing hair stylists or those who understand it can help close a gap of misunderstanding and help create a commitment to valuing diverse voices</li>
        <li>Popular gaming companies working towards inclusiveness may seem like a small step but it is actually a more powerful step than it would seem.</li>
